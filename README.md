# Castlevania-Order-of-Ecclesia-Crissaegrim-Patch

A patch for Castlevania OOE giving you 2 new weapons: The Crissaegrim and the Agartha.

The game is still vanilla for the most part. The only changes are the above 
mentioned weapons and the "lucky" accesory that gives you 7 luck as well as status
 immunity.

Also used the Shanoa Remade patch by DSythe32 since sprites look way better with it.

double-jump.
